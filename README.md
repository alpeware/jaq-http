# JAQ http

A minimal, idiomatic Clojure library for HTTP.

## Rationale

In a cloud-centric, micro-service dominated world, HTTP is the common protocol
to communicate between the different components of a system.

This library is built from the ground up to depend only on Clojure including
core.async and fully asynchronous using Java NIO primitives.


## Installation

Use in ```deps.edn``` -

```
{com.alpeware/jaq-http {:git/url "https://github.com/alpeware/jaq-http"
                            :sha "LATEST SHA"}}
```

## Status

Alpha stage - not yet production ready and with some changes expected.

## Features

- minimal, idiomatic Clojure library
- data and functional first approach to building modern web applications

## Usage

The following API is provided in `jaq.http.server`:
* `(serve xrf port) ;; start server on port

The following API is provided in `jaq.http.client`:
* `(request xrf opts) ;; perform request


## Example Usage

### Server
```clojure
(require '[jaq.http.server :as server])
(require '[jaq.http.xrf.app :as app])

;; start a echo server on port 8080
(server/serve app/echo 8080)
;; =>

;; a http repl
(server/serve app/repl 8080)
;; =>

;; see jaq.http.xrf.app for details
(server/serve
  (comp
    app/http
    (map (fn [{:keys [method path]
              {:keys [host] :headers}}]
          {:status 200 :headers {} :body (str "hi from " host)}))
    8080)

```

### Client
